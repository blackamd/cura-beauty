                                        <h3>PATRICIA <br> AMANDA</h3>
                                        <div class="category">Specialty: <span>Jiu- Jitsu , Black Belt , bodybuilding and weightlifting</span></div>
                                    </div>
                                    <p>Patricia entered the sporting life through bodybuilding in 1996. In 1998, she was
                                        invited to participate in a bodybuilding championship where she got second
                                        place in this championship. In the same year of 1998, in one of her training
                                        sessions, she was introduced to Jiu-jitsu Instructor Fabiano Montes Doca, who
                                        was a student of Master José Mário Sperry. Thus, she started the journey in
                                        Brazilian jiu-jitsu.</p>
                                    <p>After a few classes, the instructor signed her up for her first competition, becoming state champion.
                                        She competed for a few more years, but at the time, it was unusual for women to fight and as a
                                        result she ended up having no opponents. It was then that in 2001, as a pioneer, Patricia started with
                                        a female jiu-jitsu team so that more women would have the opportunity to join jiu-jitsu. I had the
                                        pleasure of having on my mat like my students Caroline De Lazzer and Bruna Moro, among others.</p>
                                    <p>Her plans to become a children's jiu-jitsu instructor surfaced with the arrival of
                                        her son. In 2002, she had her first children's jiu-jitsu class. Since then,
                                        championships were put on the back burner, as the desire to teach jiu-jitsu was
                                        stronger. She also started to give classes to male, child, juvenile, juvenile and
                                        adult male and female groups. Since then, this desire has been present in her life.</p>
