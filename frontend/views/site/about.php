            <h3>Juniors Application</h3>
            <p>
                Jiu-jitsu / MMA is the best non-violent self-defense Martial Arts for children and teens. Through demonstration, students learn a series of techniques for each class. After thorough preparation, our students implement the new technique in a controlled and supervised session, where they have the opportunity to practice techniques against a resisting opponent. <br><br>
                Lifetime of injury-prevention-skills trained professionals will supervise and teach Jiu-jitsu classes, children will learn how to build strength and endurance while minimizing the risk of injury. Classes emphasize a number of different muscle movements that incorporate full-body workouts, including arm strength, fast-twitch muscle-fiber development, and greater range of motion. The result is that students avoid the kind of injury that comes from receptive movements seen in other kinds of sports “think of a pitcher’s throwing arm, for example or a soccer player’s kicking leg.”
            </p>

            <h3>Truly Have Fun</h3>
            <p>
                While it’s true that kids will be gaining strength and learning important skills in jiu-jitsu, they’ll also be having a great time. That can have a ripple effect in many ways. It teaches them them that hard work doesn’t have to be a drag, that it’s worth the time and effort to increase ability, and most of all that fitness can be an engaging and worthwhile pursuit.
            </p>

            <h3>Greater sense of respect</h3>
            <p>
                Like any martial art, Jiu-Jitsu / MMA emphasizes respect for other students. Even in matches, students aren’t taught to battle aggressively and recklessly, but rather to use leverage, conditioning and strategy to outmatch an opponent. <br><br>
                There’s acknowledgment that fellow students and the teacher deserve to be respected. Equally valuable is that students learn to respect themselves - An enormously valuable skill that can give them confidence, competence and enthusiasm for whatever comes their way inside or outside the classroom.
            </p>

            <h3>Ability to be a part of team</h3>
            <p>
                In some ways, Jiu-Jitsu / MMA can be solo endeavor, in which each student is focusing on skill-building at his or her own level, but the sense of friendly competition and support in every class makes a student group feel like a team. <br><br>
                Being able to act as a contributing member of that team is an attribute for a lifetime. When a child learns teamwork, the result can be profound, from a greater sense of empathy to stronger social connections to better emotional control. <br><br>
                He or she can problem-solve on a different level and have a collaborative attitude toward others.
            </p>

            <h3>World Class Coaching</h3>
            <p>
                Master Coaching practices research shows that the athlete, clients coach relationship can be the definitive difference between sporting success and failure. <br><br>
                World class coaches do much more than just provide technical and tactical expertise as they adept at developing self-sufficient athletes through an acute awareness of the perceived needs of an athlete and designing a complete training structure around the athlete from A to Z.  <br><br>
                The READY FIGHT SYSTEM will be home of Master Coaches specializing in each specific combat that they are performing.
